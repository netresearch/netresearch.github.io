The project provides a JavaScript SDK which shows a widget with relevant entities for the text being analyzed which can be selected for inclusion on the target content in various ways (e.g. RDFa attributes, inclusion to sidebars, footers, injected paragraphs etc.). The backends that analyze the content are invoked using adapters (currently Apache Stanbol, others will follow). The SDK is designed to allow annotations on any web sites / apps which will involve some programming effort to get it running - however there are standard integrations for common editors and systems (currently CKEditor, more to come).',
